parse each function file we created to find out which functions it calls, and then add the necessary imports at the top of the function files. This updated script assumes that we're working with the output of the previous refactoring operation, with all function files located in a directory.

This code example performs the following:

1. Parses each function file to collect function calls.
2. Determines if the function calls refer to functions within our set of refactored files.
3. Adds import statements to the top of each file for the functions it depends on from within the folder.

1. This script assumes that the refactored functions do not call functions outside of the refactored set.
2. It does not handle calls made with alternative syntax (e.g., using `getattr()`), calls made through variables, method calls, or function calls within nested functions or classes.
3. The script checks for function filenames which correspond to function calls (i.e., it assumes that there is a 1-to-1 mapping between calls and files, without considering scope or context).
4. Each refactored file should contain only one top-level function for the import statements to work correctly without causing circular imports.
